# IT45-Project

The goal of this project is to resolve an assignment problem using the Tabu method.

To compile this project, just use the command :
````
javac *.java
````

The main function can take four parameters : <i>(boolean) showDetails, (long) execTime, (int) nbApprenants</i> and 
<i>(int) tabuLength.</i>
By default, showDetails is set to false, execTime to 10, nbApprenants to 80 and tabuLength to 500.

To run it in default mode, use the command : 
````
java Main
````

If you want to adjust the parameters, use this command :
````
java Main [true/false] execTime nbApprenants tabuLength
````
